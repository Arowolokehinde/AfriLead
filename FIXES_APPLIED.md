# Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Restored Original Landing Page Components
- **Problem**: Created new landing components instead of using existing ones
- **Solution**: 
  - Restored original components: `HeroSection`, `VisionSection`, `HowItWorksSection`, `DualValueSection`, `CommunityImpactSection`, `CTASection`
  - Updated `app/page.tsx` to use original components
  - Removed duplicate landing components from `components/landing/`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Navigation Links
- **Problem**: Navbar links pointing to `/(auth)/signin` and `/(auth)/signup` were not working
- **Solution**:
  - Moved auth pages from `app/(auth)/signin` and `app/(auth)/signup` to root level: `app/signin` and `app/signup`
  - Updated all navigation links to use `/signin` and `/signup`
  - Fixed links in:
    - `components/shared/navbar.tsx` (desktop & mobile menu)
    - `app/signin/page.tsx` (sign up link)
    - `app/signup/page.tsx` (sign in link)

### 3. ✅ Added Call-to-Action Links
- **Problem**: Hero and CTA section buttons had no links
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `components/hero-section.tsx`:
    - "Sign Up Now" → links to `/onboarding/role`
    - "Find a Mentor" → links to `/discover`
  - Updated `components/cta-section.tsx`:
    - "Join AfriLead" → links to `/onboarding/role?type=mentee`
    - "Start Mentoring Today" → links to `/onboarding/role?type=mentor`

### 4. ✅ Fixed TypeScript Errors
- Added missing `Interest` type variants: "Entrepreneurship", "Product Management"
- Fixed type assignments in mock data for:
  - `app/dashboard/mentor/page.tsx`
  - `app/discover/page.tsx`
- Fixed async params for dynamic routes
